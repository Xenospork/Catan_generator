This Repo is for files related to a project, generating printable, small random maps for a travel version of the game "Settlers of Catan". This project is completely not for profit, and is simply an expression of love for a great board game. 

The goal of the project is to automate the creation of random Catan maps of a certain size. A4 sheets of maps can therefore be generated for pritning, and the original code can be accessed for all those interested.
